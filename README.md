# CubeSat-V1
1U Cubesat having RF based communication system.
A CubeSat, short for Cube Satellite, is a type of miniaturized satellite that 
follows a standardized form factor. It was developed to provide a low-cost and 
accessible platform for scientific research, educational purposes, and various 
space missions.
The CubeSat's defining feature is its cubic shape, with a standard size of 10 
centimeters on each side, though variations exist with larger dimensions like 
1U, 2U, 3U, 6U, and even larger. These measurements are given in "U" or "U 
cubes," where 1U represents a cube of 10x10x10 centimeters.
The small size of CubeSats allows them to be easily integrated as secondary 
payloads on launch vehicles alongside larger satellites.
